# Online Retail Analysis (Databricks + SQL)

This project explores a UK Online Retail dataset using Databricks notebooks and SQL.

**Note**: I recommend checking the results on Databricks (i.e., [Databricks notebook](https://databricks-prod-cloudfront.cloud.databricks.com/public/4027ec902e239c93eaaa8714f173bcfc/1577492776175845/54283522944020/4308252803629806/latest.html)) since the cell's outputs might be long ones in the Jupyter Notebook in this repository.
